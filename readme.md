I have the best full stack naming apllication. It's really terrific. My friends always tell me, "Donald, you have such a fantastic full stack naming application."

Trump Names is the yuuuuggggeeee application that allows you to nickname my opponents or get your own name. Utilizing literally the best technologies on the planet (html, css, js, jquery, ruby, activerecord, bootstap, and postges), I am able to create nicknames for the user and my opponents as well as enlist the help of the user to edit and delete opponent names.

This is an open source project and I welcome contributions, altough I know they will not be as great as my own.
